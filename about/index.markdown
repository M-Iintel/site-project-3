    <p class="about-intro">
      Hey! I’m Ibrahim. I’m a junior software developer interested in the
      intersection of technology, politics, and economics. I enjoy working
      across different layers of the web and learning how systems behave,
      scale, and interact.
    </p>

    <p>
    I’ve been building projects using Python, C++, C#, and modern web
    technologies, focusing on clarity, performance, and long-term
    maintainability. Alongside technical work, I also develop independent
    political analyses. One example is
    <a
        class="inline-project-link"
        href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/J28243.pdf"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
    >
        a recent analytical project
    </a>
    where I examined the reasons behind Aktau plane crash and formulated original assessments.

    <p>
      I’m especially interested in early-stage ideas, where technical choices
      matter the most and where thoughtful design can shape how people interact
      with systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of programming, I actively follow political and economic trends
      and enjoy analyzing how technology influences governance, power, and
      society. During my free time, I write analyses on global political
      developments, develop my own predictions, and sometimes formalize or
      print my work for deeper reflection.
