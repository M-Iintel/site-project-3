      Where technology shapes power — and power shapes technology.

      This page is my personal space for connecting two things I’ve been serious about
      for years: understanding how the digital world works, and understanding how the
      real world is governed, influenced, and changed.

    <h2>My Story in Short</h2>

    <p>
      I’m 17, and I’ve been deeply interested in politics since I was 12.
      By 15, I started writing my own predictions about political events and trends —
      and many of those predictions turned out to be correct.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t treat politics as “news” — I treat it as a system: incentives, power,
      strategy, public opinion, and consequences. I’m interested in why decisions happen,
      not only what happened.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology Has Always Been My Second Language</h2>

    <p>
      My interest in IT started in childhood. My parents noticed I had talent and real
      curiosity, so at 11 I began studying at <strong>STEP IT Academy</strong>.
      I graduated after 5 years and received an <strong>international diploma</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I’m continuing professionally in the STEP IT senior program. I’ve learned
      <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong>CSS</strong>,
      and I’m currently learning <strong>C#</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Why IT and Politics Are Inseparable</h2>

    <p>
      Modern politics isn’t just speeches, ideology, or diplomacy anymore. Algorithms decide
      visibility, platforms shape public discourse, and data-driven systems influence policy.
      The internet became an arena — and the tools behind it decide who wins attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      From social media recommendation engines to surveillance infrastructure, digital identity,
      and cybersecurity, IT is now part of how power is exercised, defended, and challenged.
    </p>

    <h2>My Core Focus Areas</h2>

    <ul class="project-list">
      <li>Digital e-government systems</li>
      <li>AI in decision-making and policy</li>
      <li>Social media algorithms and political influence</li>
      <li>Cybersecurity, information warfare, and state power</li>
      <li>Data ethics, privacy, and civil liberties</li>
      <li>Propaganda, narratives, and digital media</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>

    <p>

    <h2>How I Think (and Write)</h2>

    <p>
      In my free time, I write analytical notes on political developments and technology trends,
      then connect them: who benefits, what incentives are created, what signals are ignored,
      and what outcomes are likely.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal isn’t to repeat popular opinions. It’s to build a framework: reasoning,
      scenarios, and predictions that can be evaluated later.
    </p>
