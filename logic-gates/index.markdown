      Exploring fundamental digital logic through physical hardware.

    <p class="project-hero-desc">
      This project focuses on implementing and explaining core digital logic
      gates — NOT, OR, AND, and NAND — using Arduino boards and discrete
      electronic components.

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      Logic gates form the foundation of all modern computing systems. This
      project was developed as a team effort (Team #15), consisting of four
      members, with the goal of translating abstract boolean logic into tangible,
      physical behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than implementing every possible gate, we focused on a selected
      subset — NOT, OR, AND, and NAND — and deeply analyzed how each gate works,
      how inputs affect outputs, and how logical decisions are represented
      through electrical signals.
    </p>

    <h2>Team & Process</h2>

    <p>
      Each team member contributed to building, testing, and explaining the
      logic gates. Using Arduino boards, breadboards, LEDs, resistors, and input
      switches, we demonstrated how different logical conditions translate into
      observable outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      A key part of the project was explanation: we walked through each gate’s
      behavior step by step, discussing truth tables, signal flow, and real-world
      implications of digital logic.
    </p>

    <h2>Demonstration Video</h2>

    <p>
      The full build process, gate behavior explanations, and team walkthrough
      are documented in the video below, where we explain how each logic gate
      works and demonstrate the results in real time.

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>

    <p>
      This project strengthened my understanding of how boolean logic is realized
      at the hardware level and how theoretical concepts directly map to physical
      systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working in a team environment also reinforced the importance of clear
      explanation, collaboration, and structured problem-solving — especially
      when dealing with foundational concepts that underpin both software and
      computer architecture.
