    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      This project was completed as part of the global <strong>Hour of AI</strong>
      initiative by <strong>Team #15</strong>, consisting of four members. The goal
      was to introduce school students to the fundamentals of artificial
      intelligence in an engaging, accessible, and age-appropriate way.
    </p>

    <p>
      We selected <em>Minecraft Hour of AI: The First Night</em> as our core
      learning activity, as it provides an intuitive visual environment where
      students can understand how AI systems make decisions, respond to inputs,
      and follow programmed logic.
    </p>

    <h2>Structure of the Session</h2>

    <p>
      The session began with a brief introduction to <strong>ADA University</strong>,
      where we explained what the university represents, its academic focus, and
      how technology and innovation are integrated into its programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, we delivered a short presentation explaining what artificial
      intelligence is, how it differs from traditional software, and how AI is
      used in everyday life — using simple examples tailored to the students’
      level of understanding.
    </p>

    <h2>Minecraft & AI Demonstration</h2>

    <p>
      Using <strong>Minecraft Education</strong>, we demonstrated how AI-driven
      agents behave inside the game environment. Through the <em>First Night</em>
      scenario, students observed how AI reacts to changing conditions, makes
      decisions, and follows predefined rules to achieve goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      This hands-on interaction helped students connect abstract AI concepts to
      visible outcomes, making learning both enjoyable and memorable.
    </p>

    <h2>Certificates & Completion</h2>

    <p>
      At the end of the session, participants received <strong>official Hour of AI
      certificates</strong> recognizing their participation and successful
      completion of the activity.

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>

    <p>
      This project strengthened my ability to explain complex technical concepts
      in a clear and engaging way, especially to a non-technical audience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working as part of a team also emphasized the importance of coordination,
      clear communication, and adaptability when delivering educational content
      in a real-world setting.
